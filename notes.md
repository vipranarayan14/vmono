# Notes

## Todos:

-[] Check best practises for use of `global` to make a local variable global.
  -[] in any case, find a work around
-[] Find a way to resize canvas along with image when window resizes.
-[] Find a way to center images in canvas
-[] Add save func and btn
-[] use low-size image - both dimensionally and memory-wise i.e. try formats other than GIF - for perview
-[] Add support for opening multiple files - array contains filenames - next btn switches to next preview.
